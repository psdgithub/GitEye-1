        <ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">In the <span class="keyword wintitle">CollabNet Sites</span> view, right-click the
                    Planning Folders node or an existing planning folder and select <span class="ph menucascade">

                        the <span class="ph uicontrol">Create new planning folder</span> icon in the planning

            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Give your planning folder a brief and descriptive name.</span>
                 For example:<ul class="ul">
                        <li class="li">In an Agile project, you'll probably want two or more iterations. Make a
                            planning folder called "Sprint 1," another called "Sprint 2," and so
                            on.</li>

                        <li class="li">In a phased, waterfall-style project, you might name your first planning
                            folder "Design," the next "Build," and so on.</li>

                    </ul>

                        your planning folders yet. The parallel process of filling out the feature
                        tree will provide plenty of material for this.</div>

                
            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Description</span> to briefly signal the kind of work
                    that will be contained in this planning folder.</span>
                 Include enough information to help people get up to speed quickly whey they
                    join your project. But save most of the detail for the individual tracker
                    artifacts, where project members will spend most of their time.
            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">For <span class="ph uicontrol">Status</span>, select a value that communicates where the
                    planning folder is in its life cycle.</span>
                 For a new planning folder, you'll probably want to select <span class="keyword option">Not
                        started</span>. 
            </li>
<li class="li step">

                    you are tracking here, you can identify it in the <span class="ph uicontrol">File
                        Release</span> field.</span>

            </li>
<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">For <span class="ph uicontrol">Capacity</span>, provide a number that expresses how much
                    work your team thinks it can do in the period represented by this planning
                    folder.</span>
                 <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> When you create a new planning folder, it can be a good idea
                        to set its capacity to zero until you get a feel for the artifacts and
                        resources you are working with.</div>

                    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The Capacity chart will be enabled only when you set a capacity for the
                        planning folder.</div>

<li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Select a start and end date for the work that this planning folder will
                    contain.</span>
                 <span class="ph">You must enter both dates, or neither.</span> You can change these dates at
                    any time. However, it's important to specify dates even if they're not firm,
                    because useful visual aids and reports depend on them.
