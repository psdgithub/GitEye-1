            <div class="section context"><p class="p">A set of user stories often includes dependency relationships that
			require that one user story be addressed before another. For example, suppose a backend
			database modification must be in place before a user interface component can be created
			to access it. Both user stories may have the same degree of priority, but one has to be
			done before the other.</p>

                  <p class="p">One way to manage this is by ranking the user stories in your
			planning view so that they reflect the sequence you want. When you do this, team members
			have a better chance of selecting work efficiently and reducing the need for rework.</p>

                  <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Rank is not the same as priority. Two artifacts may have
				the same priority but different ranks, or sequence positions.</div>
