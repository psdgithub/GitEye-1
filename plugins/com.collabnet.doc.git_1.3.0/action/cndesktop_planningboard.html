As a <span class="keyword">TeamForge</span> project administrator, you         can configure multiple planning boards for a project. You might do this if you want to         restrict the tracker types that can be displayed, or if you want to configure the layout of         the fields that can appear on the artifact cards.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../action/cndesktop_useplanningboard.html">Use the planning board</a></strong><br/>
In the planning board, you can assign artifacts to planning folders or rank them         using drag and drop, make quick changes and in-place updates, and view charts that help you         monitor progress. </li>
