    <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">A planning folder's position may reflect scheduling changes in relation to the work
        contained in other planning folders.</p>

        <div class="section context">For example, when plans change and the work represented in a later planning folder
            moves ahead of an earlier planning folder, move the folders around in the hierarchy to
            reflect the new relationship. <p class="p">When you move a planning folder, any subfolders that it contains 
                are also moved to the destination folder. Before
                promoting a planning folder to a higher level in your hierarchy of folders, make
                sure its member artifacts (and its members' parent artifacts, if any) are all
                assigned to the same planning folder, or to a planning folder that belongs to the
                same folder hierarchy.</p>
