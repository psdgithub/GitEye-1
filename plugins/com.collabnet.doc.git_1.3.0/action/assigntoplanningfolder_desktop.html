                    <p class="p">For an example of how this feature can be useful, let's say you initially assigned some artifacts to Release 1.0.  Now you are ready to review those artifacts and decide which ones will be part of Release 1.0 &gt; Iteration 1.  In this case, you could select Release 1.0 &gt; Iteration 1 in the artifact table pane, and select Release 1.0 in the backlog pane, without selecting . You then see only Release 1.0 artifacts that have not yet been assigned to an iteration.  As you drag an artifact from the backlog pane to the artifact table, it gets dropped from the backlog pane as it is added to the artifact table.  Next you might select Release 1.0 &gt; Iteration 2 in the artifact table pane.  Because  is not selected, the backlog pane does not show those artifacts that you previously assigned to Release 1.0 &gt; Iteration 1.</p>
