        <div class="section context">A planning folder is a way to organize work into feasible chunks and monitor its
            progress. When you've thought about the general categories the work falls into, you can
                to set up planning folders that reflect those ideas.
            <p class="p"> A planning folder can represent:</p>

            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">A set of tasks, such as Iteration 3, or "Initial infrastructure
                    development."</li>

                <li class="li">A period of time, such as "April," or "Q2-2010."</li>

                <li class="li">A phase of development, such as "Testing" or "Deployment."</li>

                <li class="li">A component of the product, such as "Chapter 12" or "Rear stabilizer."</li>

A planning folder is a dynamic representation of a changing situation. From time to         time, you'll want to update its name, description and scheduling parameters to reflect         changes in the underlying work.</li>

When the sequence of work in your project changes, it's a good idea to reorder the planning folders            so that they keep accurately reflecting the real order of work.</li>
