    <h1 class="title topictitle1">What can I learn from a capacity chart?</h1>

    
    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The capacity chart shows the project team's judgment of how much work can be done
        with the resources available and the time period represented in the planning
        folder.</p>

        <p class="p"> The capacity chart is for measuring capacity for a particular planning folder. Its main
            purpose is for sprint planning to assert how under- or over-capacity you are for a
            particular sprint/release. Then, during the sprint, you can tell how you are doing on
            remaining effort, estimated effort, and asserted capacity. </p>

        <p class="p">The data behind the capacity chart is updated in real time, so that your team can respond
            quickly to changes in effort estimates or relative priorities.</p>

        <p class="p">Capacity is expressed as a numeric value, using the same scale as you are using for
            estimated, remaining, actual effort accounts. </p>

        <p class="p">You can see the capacity of a planning folder in the planning folder summary view. </p>

        <div class="note tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip:</span> A planning folder's capacity must be equal to or greater than the total
            estimated effort (or total remaining effort) for the artifacts in the planning folder.
            To avoid confusion, you may want to wait for estimates to emerge before setting the
            planning folder's capacity. </div>
