    <h1 class="title topictitle1">What can I learn from an Open vs. Closed chart?</h1>


    

    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Sometimes you just want a raw count of the number of work items you are looking
        at.</p>

        <p class="p">Use the <span class="keyword wintitle">Open vs. Closed</span> chart for a quick overview of your team's
            progress in purely numerical terms. A glance at this chart can suggest some broad
            generalizations, which you'll then want to test by examining your other charts and your
            planning folder contents more closely. </p>

        <p class="p">The <span class="keyword wintitle">Open vs. Closed</span> chart is good for some basic summary
            information. You may want to share this chart with executive sponsors who need to know
            how things are going in quantitive terms, but don't need a lot of detail about the types
            of work being addressed.</p>
