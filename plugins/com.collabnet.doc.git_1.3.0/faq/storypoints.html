    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A story point is a measure of effort that expresses the relative difficulty of
        implementing a user story. You can use story points to help estimate how much work can be
        done in a sprint.</p>

        <p class="p">Story points are useful for relative measurement. A story point has no specific value in
            hours, or lines of code, or anything else. When you are estimating work, use story
            points only to compare one piece of work with another. </p>

        <p class="p">When you record a value in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Story Points</span> field of an artifact,
            that value is added to the total story points in the planning folder that the artifact
            belongs to. You can then use that figure to support forecasting.</p>
