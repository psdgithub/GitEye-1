    <h1 class="title topictitle1">What can I learn from an Open by Priority chart?</h1>


    

    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Dynamic planning is most effective when you know the relative priorities of work
        items you are tracking. The <span class="keyword wintitle">Open by Priority</span> chart helps you check that
        your team is working on the optimal mix of artifacts.</p>

        <p class="p">Use the <span class="keyword wintitle">Open by Priority</span> chart for a quick overview of the type of
            work your project is working with. A glance at this chart can suggest some broad
            generalizations, which you'll then want to test by examining your planning folder
            contents more closely. </p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">When the darker bars on the left side of the chart are high, you are probably
                working on the high-impact issues that come up earlier in a work cycle. Don't be
                surprised if the trend line in your <span class="keyword wintitle">Burndown</span> chart is not yet
                sloping steeply downward to the right.</li>

            <li class="li">When the lighter bars on the right side of the chart are high, you are likely to be
                working on cleanup issues and refinements. You may be approaching the end of the
                work cycle you defined in this planning folder. At this stage, the Closed slice of
                the <span class="keyword wintitle">Open vs. Closed</span> chart is likely to be equal to or larger
                than the Open proportion.</li>

        </ul>


        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The <span class="keyword wintitle">Open by Priority</span> chart won't tell you how much work is
            involved in the artifacts that it measures. For that, check the
                <span class="keyword wintitle">Burndown</span> chart.</div>
