	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The charts in <span class="keyword">CollabNet</span> <span class="keyword">TeamForge</span> provide a variety of graphical windows on your
		project's progress. You can print these charts, import them into presentations, or send out
		links to them.</p>

		<p class="p">Charts are a complement to the data in your planning folder, not a substitute for it.
			Each chart is good for a quick update on a particular kind of information about your
			project. For the fullest picture, consider all the charts in context, and always check
			your impressions by inspecting the detailed information contained in your tracker
			artifacts and planning folders.</p>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Your browser must have a <a class="xref" href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Flash player</a> installed to view the charts.

Burndown is the estimated amount of work that remains to be done in an iteration,         compared with the work originally estimated. </li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../faq/capacity.html">What can I learn from a capacity chart?</a></strong><br/>
The capacity chart shows the project team's judgment of how much work can be done         with the resources available and the time period represented in the planning         folder.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../faq/openbypriority.html">What can I learn from an Open by Priority chart?</a></strong><br/>
Dynamic planning is most effective when you know the relative priorities of work         items you are tracking. The <span class="keyword wintitle">Open by Priority</span> chart helps you check that         your team is working on the optimal mix of artifacts.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../faq/openvsclosed.html">What can I learn from an Open vs. Closed chart?</a></strong><br/>
Sometimes you just want a raw count of the number of work items you are looking         at.</li>
