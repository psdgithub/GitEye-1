	<h1 class="title topictitle1">What is a planning folder?</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A planning folder is a virtual container that helps you organize and plan the work
		that goes into delivering a product.</p>


		<p class="p">You can create a hierarchy of planning folders to organize artifacts by product, release,
			iteration, etc. You can store artifacts from multiple trackers in a planning folder.
			This allows you to plan various stages of your project (i.e. releases, iterations,
			etc.). </p>

		<p class="p"> Selecting an individual planning folder provides a view of all artifacts from all
			trackers within the selected planning folder. </p>

		<p class="p">The <span class="ph uicontrol">Planned For</span> field identifies which product, release, or
			iteration the artifact is planned for, based on the planning folder that it is assigned
			to. </p>

		<p class="p">For example, in an Agile development environment, a project manager breaks down the
			prospective product into its component parts and looks at what it would take to deliver
			each one. When all the parts planned for a given iteration are finished, the product is
			considered complete for that iteration.</p>

		<p class="p"> Some parts of a product can be developed more or less in isolation, but most depend on
			other parts. Tracking these relationships is one of the trickiest aspects of product
			development. </p>

		<p class="p">For example, you can only provide a graphical user interface for a shopping cart
			application if you also come up with a database for the customer's payment data to be
			stored and accessed. That in turn requires a data storage and backup solution of some
			kind. And so on. </p>

		<p class="p">Use a planning folder to track the dependencies among the parts of your project as each
			moves toward completion. As you work through the question of what depends on what,
			you'll move artifacts representing user stories into the appropriate iteration in the
			appropriate release. As you proceed, you'll find a pattern like this emerging:</p>


		<ul class="ul">
			<li class="li">Product 1 <ul class="ul">
					<li class="li">Release 1 <ul class="ul">
							<li class="li">Iteration 1</li>

							<li class="li">Iteration 2</li>

						</ul>

					</li>

					<li class="li">Release 2</li>

				</ul>

			</li>

			<li class="li">Product 2</li>

		</ul>

		<p class="p"/>

		<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> "Move" is meant figuratively. When you "move" an artifact into a planning folder, it
			is still a member of the tracker where it lives, and you can still do all the things
			with it that you can do with an ordinary tracker artifact.</div>

		<p class="p">Your planning folder lets you see at a glance the pieces of the work that support other
			pieces, and the pieces that depend on other pieces. Think of this as a "planning tree."
			If you are responsible for a development project, you can use this tree view to
			understand and predict the time and effort required to deliver a given set of
			features.</p>
