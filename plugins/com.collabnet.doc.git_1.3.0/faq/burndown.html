    <h1 class="title topictitle1">What can I learn from a burndown chart?</h1>


    

    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Burndown is the estimated amount of work that remains to be done in an iteration,
        compared with the work originally estimated. </p>

        <p class="p">At any time, you can click on a planning folder and see how the sum of the estimated and
            remaining effort for all contained and descendant features is changing within a given
            timeframe. This helps you see how the estimates for your features are changing from day
            to day, and how the team is progressing towards "done" (remaining effort at zero). </p>

        <p class="p">You can use the trend line shown in your burndown chart to do some useful things: </p>

        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Project the time when all the work for this iteration will be completed.</li>

            <li class="li">Predict the amount of work your team can expect to complete during any given
                iteration. (This is known as your team's velocity.) </li>

        </ul>

        <p class="p">The information you derive from your burndown chart will help revise the product scope,
        make accurate planning decisions, and refine implementation details.</p>

        <div class="p">Here's an example of a burndown chart.
            <div class="fig fignone">
                
                <img class="image" src="../images/screenshots/charts-burndown.png" alt="burndown"/>
            </div>

        </div>

        <p class="p">In general, a burndown chart trends downward until it reaches zero. In practice, some
            events can reverse the downward trend of your burndown chart. For example, development
            work frequently uncovers a greater scope for a user story than was initially estimated.
            As a result, you'll revise your estimate of remaining work on that story, and your
            burndown figure may be pushed upwards. </p>

        <p class="p">The burndown chart uses whatever effort units you are using in the planning folder.</p>

        <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The story told in your burndown chart is only as reliable as the underlying data. The
            owners of individual task artifacts can help keep the burndown chart accurate by
            regularly updating their remaining effort figures.</div>
